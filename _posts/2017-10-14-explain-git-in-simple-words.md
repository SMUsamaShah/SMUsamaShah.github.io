title: How to explain git in simple words?

A while ago I started hearing about Git here and there and its various strange words like branch, index, tree, commit, clone, fork, master, origin, head, check out, check in, push and pull etc. Available tutorials were difficult to understand because they jumped straight to git commands. I asked this on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-explain-the-basics-of-Git-in-simple-words-What-does-branch-index-tree-commit-clone-fork-master-origin-head-check-out-check-in-etc-mean) in hope for something more visual and easier to understand, then answered it myself getting most upvotes. I am posting it with more and hopefully better explanation here on my own blog now :)

File OR Blob
------------

All contents of a file are stored in a thing called `blob`. When a file is changed, a new blob will store complete file with all new changes. Blob is one of the basic storage units in Git. Others units/object types are Commit and Tree.

![blob]({{ "/images/git/blob.png" | absolute_url }} "A blob stores file contents")

Hash
----

`de9f2c7fd25e1b3afad3e85a0bd17d9b100db4b3`. You see a similar strange string or its short form with (first few characters) everywhere in git. This is `hash` ([SHA1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1)). A hash can point to a blob, a commit or a tree. It is 40 characters but only few are usually enough to identify a commit. For example GitHub shows first 10 characters.

![hash]({{ "/images/git/hash.png" | absolute_url }} "A Hash for each basic unit")

Tree
----

Files are stored in folders, and a folder can have many folders and files. Like files are always in some directory, a `tree` in git represent directories for blobs and other trees. 

There is always a tree on root, pointing to the tree wich contains stuff.

![tree]({{ "/images/git/tree.png" | absolute_url }} "A tree stores blobs and trees")

Commit
------

Now let say you have two files. You want to save these in a way that you can get back to them in exact same state anytime later. When you save a snapshot of it with git, a `commit` is created pointing to the tree with two blobs (lets call them blob1 and blob2). Each commit has its own hash and it also saves your message, timestamp and your info.

![commit]({{ "/images/git/commit1.png" | absolute_url }} "A commit points to tree")

When you change one file (blob1) and commit, git will store the complete file again in a new blob (blob1c). A new tree is created with a new hash pointing to blob2 and the new blob1c. Now your git repo has both versions of a file.

![commit]({{ "/images/git/commit2.png" | absolute_url }} "For each change there is a new blob and a new tree")


### Check in = Do a Commit

Check in is simply another name for doing a commit in the repository.

### Check out = Load a Commit

Similary Check out is the process of loading a commit from the repository.

### Working directory

This the git directory in which you are working. When you check-out a commit, your whole directory with all files is changed/replaced to match that commit *(except ignored files)*.

### Stage OR Index

The Index is your proposed next commit. Its a buffer before actual commit. Itâ€™s basically a loading dock where you get to determine what changes get shipped away. Since the working directory and what gets saved by Git are essentially decoupled, this allows the developer to build up their commits however they want. You can even stage a single individual line from your many changes and only commit that.

![index]({{ "/images/git/index.gif" | absolute_url }} "Index is the buffer before commit.")

History
-------

If you make some changes and commit again, the new commit will also point to the previous commit. So each new commit only knows about its previous commit (like a 'linked list' or 'tree'). When you keep changing files, a chain of commits maintains the `history` of what was done in each commit. You may load any previous commit any time.

![history]({{ "/images/git/history1.png" | absolute_url }} "Commits are connected in chain keeping history of changes")

You can see that we can have multiple commits (commit3 and commit4) pointing to same previous commit (commit2). This is called `branching`. 

Branch
------

We have seen earlier that chain of commits can go in multiple directions creating multiple branches. But also note that each commit only knows about its previous commit. If you have loaded "commit4" you can go back to "commit2" but there is no way you can reach "commit3" until you have stored its address somewhere. The thing which keeps track of different branches is named simply a `branch`.

A branch is just a *move-able* pointer which keeps pointing to latest commit in that branch. Everytime you commit, it moves to that newly made commit. Git names the default branch as `master`.

![branch]({{ "/images/git/branch1.png" | absolute_url }} "Branch is a pointer with a name, pointing to latest commit")

What branch or commit which you have currently loaded is tracking by the **HEAD**. Head always points to the commit or branch which you are on at that time.

![head branch]({{ "/images/git/branch2.png" | absolute_url }} "Head points to currently loaded branch")

You can work on each branch independently to work on different versions of your software independently e.g. for Windows XP and Windows 7. Imagine one base Linux with all different flavors as different branches. 

### Visualizing branches

Many GIT Gui tools (like SmartGit) can show graph representation of branches and commits to easily see how they are connected.

Tag (Bookmark)
--------------

Think of `tag` as bookmark. Where branch is a *move-able* pointer, a tag is *immove-able* pointer which always points to one specific commit. Tags are useful to specify a version. e.g. after a lots of commits and fixes you can tag a commit where everything working fine as `version 1.0`. 

![tag]({{ "/images/git/tag.png" | absolute_url }} "Tag is a bookmark on the specified commit")

Remote
------

Multiple people can work on a git repository. Each person gets his/her own copy of the whole repository. It is setup usually like this. There is one centeral repository, everyone who wants to work on it makes its **clone** (copy) on their own computer. For each person, the original repository from where they made the copy is a `remote` repo.

### Clone and Fork

`Clone` is the process of copying a repository. After clone, the orignal repository is added as its remote. Push and Pull can be performed on that remote. `Fork` is just a different name used by GitHub or Bitbucket in a sense that a fork operation clones the repository to your github account instead of your computer.

### Fetch

The process of getting updates/changes from remote is called `pull`. When pulled, latest commits are download to the user's computer. These changes are then applied with a `merge` command.

### Pull

Pull downloads the changes and applies them in one go automatically.


### Push

Push is the process of uploading your changes to remote repository
