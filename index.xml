      <description>Try asking any chatbot something along the lines of
 What did I just ask/tell you? What was my last/previous message?  All of them fail. All of them.
GPT-3 is equally dumb smooth talker who can jump into any discussion, clever to detect the pattern of discussion and generate next sentences.</description>

      <title>CanvasRecorder.js</title>
      <link>https://smusamashah.github.io/canvas-recorder/</link>

      <description>I made some visualizations in HTML5 canvas and wanted to record them to display in blog. Could not find a simple way to do that. CCapture.js added too much performance overhead which made animations slow. CanvasRecorder.js uses built in MediaRecorder which is apparently the simplest and most effitient way to record whatever is happening on canvas.
NOTE: I have only tested it with Chrome and it should work fine with Firefox</description>

      <title>Visualize sorting algorithms side by side</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago I found out this imgur gallery of sorting algorithms through a reddit post. The patterns which emerged while sorting random data looked very beautiful and amazing with the only catch that they were not interactive. You can not play with them. I decided make them in JavaScript to see what many different sorting algorithms look like, the patterns they create, while also learning them in the process.</description>

      <title>How to explain git in simple words?</title>
      <link>https://smusamashah.github.io/explain-git-in-simple-words/</link>

      <guid>https://smusamashah.github.io/explain-git-in-simple-words/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I started hearing about Git here and there and its various strange words like branch, index, tree, commit, clone, fork, master, origin, head, check out, check in, push and pull etc. Available tutorials were difficult to understand because they jumped straight to git commands. I approached &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-explain-the-basics-of-Git-in-simple-words-What-does-branch-index-tree-commit-clone-fork-master-origin-head-check-out-check-in-etc-mean&#34;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt; in hope for something more visual and easier to understand, then answered it myself getting most upvotes. Now posting it here on my own blog with hopefully even better explanation :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had trouble finding the index of DirectX 10 method &lt;code&gt;OMGetRenderTargets&lt;/code&gt; for hooking. I found these VTables (ID3D10Device and ID3D11DeviceContext) somewhere on the web. Putting these here to save the trouble for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
